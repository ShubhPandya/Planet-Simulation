# **Planetary Orbit Simulation using Pygame**
## **Overview**
This project simulates the motion of planets around the Sun based on Newton's law of universal gravitation. The simulation includes planets like Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus, and visualizes their orbits in real-time.
## **Features**
- Accurate simulation of planetary orbits using physics-based calculations.
- Displays the distance from planets to the Sun in kilometers.
- Visualizes planetary paths as they move.
## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
## **Simulation Details**
- Planets Modeled: Sun,Earth,Mars,Mercury,Venus
- Gravitational Law: The gravitational force between two bodies is calculated using Newton's law:
  - F = G*((m1*m2)/(r*r))
- Units:
  - 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) = 149.6 million km.
  - Time step: 1 day.
## **Future Impovements**
- Add more planets or celestial bodies.
- Include UI to dynamically add planets.
